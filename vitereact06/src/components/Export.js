//This is the best practice to export components(if more than one) by simply exporting InputBox(here only 1 element
//but if more than 1 element is present then it is written inside curly braces by comma separating)and whereever we
//want we import it by index.js file
// import InputBox from './Inputbox';
// export {InputBox};

// Make sure when you importing it in App.jsx file you write--
// import {InputBox} from './components/Export'
